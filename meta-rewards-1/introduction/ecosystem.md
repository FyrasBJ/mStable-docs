# Ecosystem

Part of what makes DeFi so powerful is its composability. In DeFi, lending services, derivatives markets and exchange functionality can be mixed and matched with tokenised assets to create novel systems and applications. We support the growth of the DeFi ecosystem as a whole, and want to reward applications and users for contributing to this growth. 

Meta will be paid to:

* users that ‘lock-up’ their mASSET in utility generating DeFi services, such as liquidity and lending pools. 
* applications that integrate the mStable SDK or mStable assets. 

## Example

mAsset contributions to any of these DApps are weighted equally in terms of rewards \(ie. a 1000 mUSD contribution to a lending, derivative platform, or liquidity pool will earn an identical amount of MTA\). As users can add and withdraw funds as they wish, the monthly Ecosystem reward pool tranche is paid out to users based on a time weighted value. 

Our user locks 10,000 mUSD along with some Ether in the Uniswap ETH/mUSD pool for 15 days \(half the time of the 30 day tranche window\), before withdrawing it to spend. The ecosystem reward pool for this tranche is 100,000 MTA, and across three DeFi apps 500,000 mUSD in total has been contributed by mStable users in the form of mAssets over the month.

Based on these values, we can calculate our users MTA reward, where:

*  t = Time user's mAssets are locked in a DeFi app¹
* T = Total reward tranche time \(1 month\)
* R = Total MTA reward for the period
* a = Amount of mAsset user contributes to ecosystem platform\(s\)
* A = Total mAsset volume contributed by all users to DeFi apps over tranche window

$$
reward = (t/T⋅a/A)⋅R
$$

Substituting our values in, we get a reward allocation of **1000 MTA** for our user's contribution over the month.
