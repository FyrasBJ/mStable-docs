# Open Reward Pool

{% hint style="info" %}
Whilst the 20m of MTA is committed to public rewards over the next 5 years, the granular details of the emission curve itself may be altered over time.
{% endhint %}

mStable uses reward mechanisms to incentivise its users to act in the best interest of the ecosystem as it grows. In total, just over 20,000,000 MTA \(20% of Meta’s total supply\) will be emitted via an open reward pool to directly incentivise those that provide resources to bootstrap the minting of mStable assets, and to fund their liquidity and utility. This has a dual benefit of creating a fair and wide distribution of the Meta token.

These rewards are used for [Ecosystem](ecosystem.md) incentives, and are paid out in monthly tranches. The emission of these rewards will remain stable or increase over the first 12 months from the beginning of the program, and then decline slowly until the pool is exhausted. We expect this reward pool to be a long term feature of the platform. Alongside this, any tail emission of MTA will also be used to contribute to these pools. Users will be paid out their rewards after a brief lock-up period. 

This reward pool is open to anyone. By leveraging this reward mechanisms, combined with our SAVE product, we believe users can get the best available return available on their stablecoin holdings.

Our public rewards pool includes bonus rewards in month 0 associate with our Genesis Event, before consolidating into an emission over 5 years as shown below. This chart is indicative as to how we envision the rewards emission will look. In reality, the team in consultation with the mStable community will decide specific reward amounts on a periodic basis.
