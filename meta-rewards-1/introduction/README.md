# Public MTA Rewards

{% hint style="info" %}
The majority of MTA is committed to public rewards and grants. Details will be communicated via our public channels.
{% endhint %}

* mStable uses reward mechanisms to incentivise its users to act in the best interest of the ecosystem as it grows. Over 50,000,000 MTA \(50% of Meta’s total supply\) will be distributed to our users and contributors over the coming years. 
* Our [Ecosystem Rewards](ecosystem.md) rewards those who contribute to the utility of mStable mAssets and the MTA token
* The [mStable Grants program](../grants-program.md) will also reward those who build on mStable
