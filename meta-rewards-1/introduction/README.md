* mStable uses reward mechanisms to incentivise its users to act in the best interest of the ecosystem as it grows. The majority Meta’s total supply will be distributed to our users and contributors over the coming years. 
* Our [EARN Rewards](ecosystem.md) program rewards those who contribute to the utility of mStable mAssets and the MTA token.
* The [mStable Grants program](../grants-program.md) will also reward those who build on mStable or contribute to its growing Community.
