# Grants Program

Through this initiative, we’ll be looking to distribute up to USD $200k over the next 12 months to relevant and valuable contributors to the mStable project and community.

This post will aim to answer some of the initial questions you might have about the program. Further information can be found on our [GitHub repository](http://github.com/mstable/dev-grants), which you should read before applying.

## What Are We Funding? <a id="7e66"></a>

### Software Development Grants

The mStable grants team is looking to mainly fund development efforts from members of the community. More specifically we’re looking to fund the following broad verticals:

* MTA integration into applications \(MTA utility\)
* mUSD / mBTC integrations \(mAsset utility\)
* Community tools \(explorers, wallets, .info sites, forums, etc.\)
