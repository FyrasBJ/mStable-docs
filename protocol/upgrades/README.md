# Upgrades

### MIP & MCCP Rationale <a id="mip--mccp-rationale"></a>

We intend MIPs and MCCPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions for changes to mStable. Because they are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

It is highly recommended that a single MIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the MIP, the more successful it is likely to be.

An MIP or MCCP must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement.
