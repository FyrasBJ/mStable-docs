# MCCPs

### What is an MCCP? <a id="what-is-an-mccp"></a>

MCCPâ€™s are documents for making a case for modifying one of the system configuration variables. The intent is to provide a clear and detailed history behind each configuration change and the rationale behind it at the time it was implemented. The author of the document is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
