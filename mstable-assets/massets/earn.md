# EARN

## All your MTA rewards in one place

EARN is a dashboard through which our users can see all of their yield farming options on mStable in one convenient place. It is the place where all of our [Ecosystem Rewards](../../meta-rewards-1/introduction/ecosystem.md) are currently distributed, and will likely be where future initiatives and incentives will be made accessible.

Currently, EARN lists incentivised liquidity pools from [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) and [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/). These pools are changed in response to dialogue with the community. Reward amounts can be changed, new pools included, and old pools excluded, on a weekly basis. This process will soon be automated, with governance directing where rewards are sent.

### Earning MTA

To earn MTA rewards, you must contribute liquidity pool tokens from the relevant pool to the mStable EARN contracts. **Contributing to the underlying liquidity pools and not the EARN contracts will result in missed rewards,** so it's important to check EARN to confirm that your liquidity contributions have been put to work.

### Impermanent Loss

Finally, it is important to state that participation in these liquidity pools does expose you to **impermanent loss**. In particular, pools containing volatile tokens as one or both side of the pool, are very susceptible to impermanent loss as the price of the volatile token changes. Please do your own due diligence on impermanent loss before choosing to use EARN.
