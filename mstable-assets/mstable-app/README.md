# mStable App

The mStable app works on Ethereum and Polygon - use the topbar to switch networks.

On the mStable app, you can interface with mStable contracts such as 

* [MINT](https://docs.mstable.org/mstable-assets/massets/minting-and-redemption) and redeem mAssets, allowing you to convert bAssets into mAssets
* [SWAP](https://docs.mstable.org/mstable-assets/massets/swapping) between bAssets
* [SAVE](https://docs.mstable.org/mstable-assets/massets/native-interest-rate) mAssets in the mStable Savings Contract and earn yield
* [POOL](https://app.gitbook.com/@mstable/s/mstable/~/drafts/-M_RJz4zA8CLNL5jq6k6/mstable-assets/massets/pools) mAssets and feeder assets into a Feeder Pool and earn rewards

Additionally, you can find a [STATS](https://app.mstable.org/#/musd/stats) page to view protocol stats.
