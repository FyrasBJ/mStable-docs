# Interfacing with mStable

## How can I access the mStable protocol?

The protocol exists as open-access [Smart Contracts ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract)on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) blockchain, meaning interacting with the protocol is permissionless - anyone can build a DApp layer or communicate directly with the blockchain to access the mStable protocol. 

We recommend accessing the contracts through:

### Our App

The first [mStable App](https://app.mstable.org/) is a lite, user focussed web application that allows users to:

* [Mint and Redeem](../massets/minting-and-redemption/) mASSETS
* Earn [Rewards](../../meta-rewards-1/introduction/) for contributing to the growth of mStable

### A custom dApp or partner DeFi project

dApps or partner DeFi projects wishing to interact with mStable in order to access mASSET and bASSET liquidity, participate in the rewards schemes, capitalise on arbitrage or simply to create an app in their own style can do so. 

Our protocol exists as open-access [Smart Contracts ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract)on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) blockchain. You can simply use a JS tool like [ethers.js ](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/)to connect your web application to Ethereum.

{% hint style="info" %}
Do you **want to integrate with mStable?** Smart contract integration details are available on the [Developers](../../developers/integrating-mstable/developers.md) page
{% endhint %}

### Communicate directly

It is possible, but not recommended to communicate directly through a Wallet provider \(e.g. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com)\). Doing so means writing your own transaction, which is something you should avoid doing.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use a robust application \(e.g. the mStable App\) to interact with the mStable protocol
{% endhint %}

## Using mASSETS

While [mASSETS](../massets/) are produced and managed through the mStable protocol, they comply with the [ERC20 standard ](https://docs.ethhub.io/built-on-ethereum/erc-token-standards/erc20/)meaning it is easy to use mASSETS in any dApp or wallet that supports ERC20 tokens. 

**Importantly, you don't need to mint mASSETS.** There are markets for them ****on the secondary market through third party exchanges such as [Uniswap](https://uniswap.exchange/swap) and [Balancer](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x72Cd8f4504941Bf8c5a21d1Fd83A96499FD71d2C).
