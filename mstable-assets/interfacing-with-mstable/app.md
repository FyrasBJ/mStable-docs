### What?

The [mStable App](app.md) is a slim, user focussed web application that allows users to:

* [MINT](../massets/minting-and-redemption/) and redeem mAssets, allowing you to convert bAssets into mAssets for free
* [SWAP](../massets/swapping.md) between bAssets
* [SAVE](../massets/native-interest-rate.md) mAssets in the mStable Savings Contract
* [EARN](../functions/) rewards for contributing to the growth of mStable
  * View the reward pools and the history of their allocations

The App is the first product built using the [mStable SDK](sdk.md). Common functionality used here will be dissected, repackaged and re-purposed for the initial integration partners.

#### How?

Built using `React (Context/Hooks)`, [`web3-react`](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react/), `ethers.js` and `Typescript`. It will be be open source.
