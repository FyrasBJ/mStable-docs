## mStable App

{% embed url="https://app.mstable.org" caption="^ Link to the app" %}

### What?

The [mStable App](app.md) is a slim, user focussed web application that allows users to:

* [MINT](../massets/minting-and-redemption/) and redeem effortlessly mASSETS, allowing you to convert bASSETS into mASSETS for free
* [SWAP](../massets/swapping.md) between bASSETS at zero slippage
* [SAVE](../massets/native-interest-rate.md) mASSETS in the mStable Savings Contract
* [EARN](../functions/) rewards for contributing to the growth of mStable
  * View the reward pools and the history of their allocations

Upon listing or inclusion in existing DeFi applications, the mStable App will also allow users to utilize mASSETS across DeFi, and get [rewarded](../../meta-rewards-1/introduction/ecosystem.md) for doing so.

The App is the first product built using the [mStable SDK](sdk.md). Common functionality used here will be dissected, repackaged and re-purposed for the initial integration partners.

#### How?

Built using `React (Context/Hooks)`, [`web3-react`](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react/), `ethers.js` and `Typescript`. It will be be open source.

## mStable Dashboard

### What?

mStable dashboard provides a comprehensive interface into the mStable protocol. 

Aside from the core functionality of minting and redemption, the Dashboard provides visibility and metrics on all on-chain information including [Basket composition](../massets/minting-and-redemption/rebalancing.md), Forge velocity, [Staking]() and [Governance](../functions/governance.md) votes. 

### When?

See [Roadmap](../../appendix/roadmap.md).
