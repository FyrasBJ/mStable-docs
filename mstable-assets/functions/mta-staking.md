# MTA Staking

Staking `MTA` is the first step required to participate in mStable's governance.

#### **Staking V1**

This is the current implementation of `MTA` staking, and went live at the end of September 2020. Once a Meta holder locks their tokens in the staking contract and begins voting on proposals they become a Governor. Staking V1 has the following characteristics:

* Longer staking lockups result in higher staking returns \(in `MTA`\) and higher voting weights \(i.e. the longer you stake, the more skin in the game you have. Because of this, the longer you stake, the more power the user has over the vote\)
* Staking `MTA` does not expose the staker to loss in the event of a bAsset losing its peg
* Stakers will need to manually migrate over to the V2 contract when it goes live \(assuming v2 is approved by these same governors\)

Meta Governors are able to stake their tokens and participate in on chain voting via snapshot with staked their Meta. Stakers can lock up their tokens for a period of time that ranges from 1 week from lockup to the end of September 2021. By this time, Staking V2 is expected to have been implemented with `MTA` staking migrated over to the new contracts.
