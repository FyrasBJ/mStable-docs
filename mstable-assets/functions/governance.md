# Governance

## Role of Governance

The Meta token aims to coordinate decentralised governance by incentivising stakeholders to act in the best interests of mStable. Meta holders will be incentivised to maximise the overall growth, use and stability of mStable given:

Governance decisions were initially be determined by the core team, but are [shifting to a community-based proposal system](../../protocol/versioning.md) as mStable decentralises. Currently, discussion of governance topics takes place in our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/pgCVG7e) and [forum](https://forum.mstable.org/), with token holders signalling their vote preferences on [snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/mstable). Only changes that have passed through a snapshot vote can be implemented. 

Once fully built out, the proposal system will automatically govern the parameters of and execute actions in mStable, encompassing the: 

* addition/removal of mAssets;
* addition/removal of bAssets and their max weights,
* addition/removal of underlying lending markets for bAssets,
* redemption and minting fees;
* selection of oracles \(if needed\);
* upgradability of system modules, such as Re-collateralisation and Governance;

**Distribution of Meta**

Robust governance includes a large and decentralised stakeholder-base. A single entity or a small group of closely aligned entities would centralize mStable and potentially create a dangerous single point of failure. It is a core project aim to ensure a broad Meta distribution so that mStable becomes sufficiently decentralised as soon as possible.

The mStable [Public Rewards](../../meta-rewards-1/introduction/), [Staking](mta-staking.md), and [Grants Program](../../meta-rewards-1/grants-program.md) are our first steps in this direction, rewarding those who positively contribute to mStable.

More granular information about Meta's distribution can be found on our [medium page](https://medium.com/mstable).
