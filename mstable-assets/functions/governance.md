# Governance

## Role of Governance

Governance is an emerging yet critically important area in cryptocurrency based mechanism design. The Meta token aims to coordinate decentralised governance by incentivising stakeholders to act in the best interests of mStable. Meta holders will be incentivised to maximise the overall growth, use and stability of mStable given:

Governance decisions will initially be determined by the core team, but will [shift to a community-based proposal system](../../protocol/versioning.md) as mStable decentralises. The initial protocol contains an upgradable governance module, with the first version facilitating proposals between a closed group of  participants whilst remaining visible and transparent. 

The proposal system will govern the parameters of and execute actions in mStable, encompassing the: 

* addition/removal of mASSETS;
* addition/removal of bASSETS and their max weights,
* addition/removal of underlying lending markets for bASSETS,
* redemption and minting fees;
* selection of oracles \(if needed\);
* upgradability of system modules: Re-collateralisation and Governance;

**Distribution of Meta**

Robust governance includes a large and decentralised stakeholder-base. A single entity or a small group of closely aligned entities would centralize mStable and potentially create a dangerous single point of failure. It is a core project aim to ensure a broad Meta distribution so that it becomes sufficiently decentralised as soon as possible.

The mStable [Public Reward Pool](../../meta-rewards-1/introduction/) is our first step in this direction. The Public Reward Pool pays those who contribute to mStable's liquidity and utility. This has been designed in the spirit of generalized mining, whereby users are rewarded for their work in growing and contributing to the growth the mStable. 

More granular information about Meta's distribution can be found on our [medium page](https://medium.com/mstable). 

## Staking

Once sufficiently decentralised, mStable will be controlled not by a single entity but by a global community of Meta Governors. Each system parameter will be determined by these governors.To participate in governance, users must stake Meta and vote on proposals. By staking Meta and voting, a user becomes a Meta Governor. The amount of Meta a user stakes is proportionate to that user's vote weighting.
