  â“‚ Meta lies at the heart of the mStable Standard. It is what ensures the
  integrity of our system in the event of permanent loss.

# Meta

## **mStable has a protocol token, Meta \(MTA\), with three core functions:**

1. To act as the ultimate source of [re-collateralisation](recollateralisation.md) \(insurance\)
2. To coordinate [decentralised governance](governance.md)
3. To incentivise [bootstrapping](../../meta-rewards-1/introduction/) of mASSET liquidity, utility and a community of Governors

In return for performing these functions and taking on this risk of liquidation in a peg loss event, Meta tokens earn income from fees collected in the platform and interest generated on its underlying assets. 

Stakers will receive an mStable asset denominated return. For example, for staking Meta, a user may receive mUSD, mGLD and mBTC.
