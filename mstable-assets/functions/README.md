  integrity of our system in the event of permanent loss.

# Meta

## **mStable has a protocol token, Meta \(MTA\), with three core functions:**

1. To coordinate [decentralised governance](governance.md)
2. To incentivise [bootstrapping](../../meta-rewards-1/introduction/) of mASSET liquidity, utility and a decentralised community of Governors
3. To act as the ultimate source of [re-collateralisation](recollateralisation.md)
