  â“‚ Meta lies at the heart of the mStable Standard. It is what drives token
  governance, incentivises public rewards, and may in future ensure the
  integrity of the system in the event of permanent loss.

# Meta

## **mStable has a protocol token, Meta \(MTA\), with three core functions:**

1. To coordinate [decentralised governance](governance.md).
2. To incentivise [bootstrapping]() of mAsset liquidity, utility and a decentralised community of Governors.
3. To act as the source of [re-collateralisation](recollateralisation.md) if it is implemented in future.
