  â“‚ Meta lies at the heart of the mStable Standard. It is what ensures the
  integrity of our system in the event of permanent loss.

# Meta

## **mStable has a protocol token, Meta \(MTA\), with three core functions:**

1. To act as the ultimate source of [re-collateralisation](recollateralisation.md)
2. To coordinate [decentralised governance](governance.md)
3. To incentivise [bootstrapping](../../meta-rewards-1/introduction/) of mASSET liquidity, utility and a community of Governors

In return for performing these functions and taking on the risk of partial liquidation in a peg loss event, governors can choose for Meta tokens to earn income from fees collected in the platform and interest generated on its underlying assets. This will be decided in future once mStable is sufficiently decentralised.

If this happens, stakers would receive an mStable asset denominated return. For example, for staking Meta and becoming a governor, a user may receive mUSD, mGLD, and mBTC. Meta itself does not earn any kind of return or reward if left unstaked by a user, and has no influence over the system's governance.
