# Meta

### What is Meta?

Meta \(MTA\) coordinates mStableâ€™s decentralised governance, fosters long-term alignment for stakeholders, and creates value for the protocol and its users.

### How to obtain MTA?

MTA can be earned by using or contributing to mStable:

* Depositing into Save
* Providing liquidity on our Feeder Pools
* Staking MTA
* Contributing to mStable through our Grants Program
* Work on Bounties
* Ad-hoc assignments and volunteer work

MTA can also be bought on major centralised and decentralised exchanges such as:

* Uniswap
* Balancer
* Bancor
* Sushiswap
* 1inch
* Huobi Global
* FTX
* Gate.io
* Bilaxy

See [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/meta#markets) for a list of markets

### What's the utility of MTA?

MTA is used for liquidity mining to bootstrap a decentralised community of governors. 

MTA can be staked to earn staking rewards and boosted rewards across the protocol to incentivise long-term holders.

By staking, MTA governors vote on the direction of the protocol, parameters and funding.

As the protocol grows, value accrual mechanisms will be used to continuously drive value to MTA. For example, a buyback and make mechanism has been recently implemented to buyback MTA on [Balancer](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x02ec2c01880a0673c76e12ebe6ff3aad0a8da968/).

## Where can I use MTA?

You can use MTA across DeFi. 

Some examples include:

* Lending and borrowing on Cream
* Liquidity provision on Uniswap, Bancor or Balancer
* Yield farming on Uniswap and Balancer
* Staked to boost rewards
* mStable Governance
