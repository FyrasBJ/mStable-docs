# Interfacing with mStable

### **How can I access the mStable protocol?**

The protocol exists as open-access [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and [Polygon](https://polygon.technology), meaning interacting with the protocol is permissionless - anyone can build a dApp layer or communicate directly with the blockchain to access the mStable protocol.

One such app is the [mStable App](https://docs.mstable.org/mstable-assets/interfacing-with-mstable/app): a slim, user focussed web application that allows users to:

* [MINT](https://docs.mstable.org/mstable-assets/massets/minting-and-redemption) and redeem mAssets, allowing you to convert bAssets into mAssets for free
* [SWAP](https://docs.mstable.org/mstable-assets/massets/swapping) between bAssets
* [SAVE](https://docs.mstable.org/mstable-assets/massets/native-interest-rate) mAssets in the mStable Savings Contract and earn yield
* [POOL](https://app.gitbook.com/@mstable/s/mstable/~/drafts/-M_RJz4zA8CLNL5jq6k6/mstable-assets/massets/pools) mAssets and feeder assets into a Feeder Pool and earn rewards

### Communicate directly

It is possible, but not recommended to communicate directly through a Wallet provider \(e.g. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com)\). Doing so means writing your own transaction, which is something you should generally avoid doing.
