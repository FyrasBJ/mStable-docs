# SAVE

## Deposit and redeem mAssets from SAVE

mAssets \(e.g. mUSD\) may be deposited into the relevant SAVE contract to earn a yield. Once deposited, mAsset is held on the SAVE contract but may be redeemed at any time with the imUSD token. 

To deposit and redeem, interact with the `SAVE` contract.
