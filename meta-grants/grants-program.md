# Grants Program

The mStable Grants Program empowers the community to help grow the mStable ecosystem. Grants are administered by the community-led mStable [GrantsDAO](https://www.notion.so/GrantsDAO-8e21f902594749c198ca2edf44d4c278), which facilitates the process of providing grants to projects, ideas and events that build on top of mStable.

This page will provide a high-level overview of the Grants Program. Further information can be found in our [documentation](https://www.notion.so/mStable-Grants-Program-f4e352b2a4f04380bd0697b2e107e82a) on Notion.

## What Are We Funding? <a id="7e66"></a>

The mStable GrantsDAO has allocated 100,000 MTA every quarter for funding grants, unless the previous quarter's funds are less than 50% utilized.

As long as you are building something useful for the mStable ecosystem, we welcome you to apply for our developer and community grants.

### Software Development Grants

The mStable DAO is looking to mainly fund development efforts from members of the community. More specifically weâ€™re looking to fund the following broad verticals:

* mUSD / mBTC integrations \(mAsset utility\)
* MTA integration into applications \(MTA utility\)
* Community tools \(explorers, wallets, .info sites, forums, etc.\)

### Community Building Grants

We are also looking to fund organic and grassroots community initiatives to build and strengthen mStable's community of members and Governors including:

* Translation and content 
* Marketing campaigns
* Infographics
* Community tools and utilities
