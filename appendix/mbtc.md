# mBTC

The past several months has seen tremendous volumes of Bitcoin brought onto the Ethereum blockchain - topping US$2.0B in October - for use in DeFi applications.

mStable’s smart contracts are built to be generic for mAssets and bAssets. We are in the initial phases of launching mBTC with several bAssets such as wBTC, renBTC and sBTC all being considered for inclusion. mBTC will launch once the new AMM is live.

We are working hard to evaluate some of the underlying bAssets and consider solutions to some of their limitations, for example, if decentralised lending markets do not exist for some of these bAssets

_We expect this to be implemented by January 2021._
