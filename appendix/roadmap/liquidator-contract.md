# Liquidator Contract

### Summary

We have implemented a liquidator contract that automatically sells any farmed rewards tokens like COMP to boost the SAVE APY.  The technical MIP [has been proposed](https://github.com/shapeshed/MIPs/blob/gh-pages/MIPS/mip-x.md) alongside a community [governance proposal](https://snapshot.page/#/mstable/proposal/QmQnKKcyyk3dAB1KLjA6eVn83A3Xp1QY3WqsymnFc73M1R) ahead of implementation.

_This was implemented in October 2020 after being approved by MTA Governors._
