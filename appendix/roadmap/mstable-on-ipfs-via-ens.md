# mStable on IPFS via ENS

Part of decentralising mStable means creating ways to access the app on decentralised infrastructure.

The mStable app and Governance app are now both available via IPFS via ENS, providing wide availability without relying on centralised infrastructure. All mStable web products are already fully open source and when made available on IPFS, it will be even easier for anyone to host them.

_We expect this to be implemented by November 2020._
