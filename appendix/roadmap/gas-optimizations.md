# Gas optimizations

A great user experience is one of mStable's guiding pillars for long-term protocol success. It should be easy and affordable for both new and existing users to use our products regardless of the USD size of their order.

Users can expect a significant improvement to gas fees when making small deposits, redemptions and swaps on the platform. Our initial research has demonstrated up to 85% savings across various app functions such as minting, swapping and redeeming mUSD. You can read more about MIP-3 [here](https://mips.mstable.org/MIPS/mip-3).

_We expect this to be implemented in November 2020, assuming MTA Governor approval._
