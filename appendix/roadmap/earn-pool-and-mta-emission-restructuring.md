# EARN pool & MTA Emission Restructuring

Since launch EARN pools have been an important source of deep and reliable mUSD and MTA liquidity across the DeFi ecosystem. Liquidity providers are rewarded with Meta for providing liquidity to these pools, and their aim has always been to grow the utility of mUSD and MTA over the long-term.

We are actively researching new ways and an innovative reward emission that incentivises users to stake for the long term and helps to disincentivize flash yield farmers who only provide liquidity for a short period of time.

The community has proposed several ways such as rewards multiplier for longer staking periods. The team is actively considering all ideas and will share more information when available.

_We expect the Public Rewards restructure to be finalised by December 2020/January 2021._
